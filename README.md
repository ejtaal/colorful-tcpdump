# colorful-tcpdump

Welcome to Colorful tcpdump!

# What does it do?

This script aims to make tcpdump output even more useful for debugging any and all network related issues, by adding colors and meta data for IPs and connections observed.

Please see the feature list below.

# Features

- detect local IPs used, either autonomously or by parsing it from provided 'ip addr' output.
- based on local IPs, change output so the local IPs are always displayed on the left and the arrows correspondingly switch around as well
- color code IPs, port numbers, and other interesting meta info found within or added to the output.
- provide meta information along with each IP in the output. This includes country code and other info gained from public sources, such as TOR status, ASN info, cloud provider meta info, etc. Again this is colour coded.
- When a DNS query is performed the results are cached. If an IP is subsequently seen that matches some of the resolved IPs replace it with the name that was searched for. This is a bit more intelligent than doing dumb reverse IP lookups that would often yield unhelpful results. Note this doesn't work with `tcpdump -q ...` as this doesn't print the full DNS query and results.
- cuts off long lines when they don't fit in the terminal by default (and supports terminal resizing), but has an option to wrap them instead also.
- time stamps colorized in a rolling rainbow just because we can :)

# Screenshots

Since a word only conveys a milli-picture, here are some screenshots:

An example session showing some connections related to a Tor server in India, connections being made by a Firefox browser that is starting up and performing checks and logins, and some other connections. Note [GOOG] and [CF] denoting published IP ranges by Google and Cloudflare respectively.

Note that when the IP is first pinged, there is no info on its DNS name. Once the DNS lookup is performed by ping, CTD tracks and displays it with the IP.

Colorful rainbow rotating timestamps may help in visual identification of time passed between packets.

# Why?

One of my favorite tools of all time, tcpdump, has been long overdue to receiving some TLC in the form of nice colors in 2023 and beyond.

# INSTALL

(recommended: set up a virtualenv 'ctd' for the following)
pip3 install colorama netifaces maxminddb_geolite2

# USAGE

Make sure the python modules are installed, or you are in your nominated virtualenv python environment.

```
$ ./ctd --help
usage: colorful-tcpdump.py [-h] [--info IP] [-d] [-w] [--nocolor] [-nl]
                           [--myip-override IP] [--debug]
                           [TCPDUMP_LIKE_CMD]

A script to prettify tcpdump output with colours, add extra info regarding IPs seen, and
add some other enhancements to the output.

positional arguments:
  TCPDUMP_LIKE_CMD      The command to run, from which output is read and colorized. This
                        is assumed to be tcpdump or similar (support for others is TODO)

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --info IP             Tell me what you know about this IP and then quit.
  -d, --detect-local-from-input
                        Do not detect local interfaces in code, but detect them from
                        running e.g. `ip addr` prior to the tcpdump command. This is
                        useful for when output is read from a remote ssh tcpdump command
                        instead of a locally running one, e.g. `./ctd -d ssh
						user@remotehost "ip addr; tcpdump -qlni eth0"`
  -w, --wrap            Wrap long lines. Default is to cut lines that don't fit in the
                        terminal
  --nocolor             Do away with all the eye candy colors!. Use this in scripts when
                        you just want to capture plain text info without all the ANSI
                        color sequences.
  -nl, --nologo         Skip showing the super cool logo
  --myip-override IP    set a local IP manually
  --debug               Print way more debugging info.

```

At the moment it needs to be called from the cloned folder, like so:

```
./ctd sudo tcpdump -lni eth0 icmp or port 53
```

Other examples of popular options include:

```
./ctd --nocolor --info 1.1.1.1
```



# TODO

Features
	- Lookup system connections to see if a local - remote connection can be matched to a process, and add a short process name[PID] to the end of the line ( e.g. `firefox[1234]`), https://psutil.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#psutil.net_connections
	- get rid of the './ctd' wrapper, and use the script itself with a suitable system call instead like a grown up
	- Tag everything based on ASN?
	- Use a more optimized IP lookup module, namely ___
	- clean up the code which is currently a bit of a patchwork of stackoverflow solutions (ðŸ™ˆ)

Data
	- More cloud providers (could be got from ASN?)
	- VPN providers (unfortunately more and more are reluctant to share this data without subscribing to their service)
	- Internetwide scanners
