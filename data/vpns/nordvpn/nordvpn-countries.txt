VPN servers act as a secure relay between your device and the internet. They are integral to your security and privacy online. First, online traffic between you and our VPN servers is encrypted, shielding your online activities from prying eyes. Second, websites and services only see the VPN server’s IP address, hiding your virtual location. To learn more about what NordVPN can do, read our handy  What is a VPN  primer.           Can I run my own VPN server?           You can, but it’s not that simple. Even with a host of online tutorials, setting up a secure VPN server requires a lot of IT knowledge and patience. Mistakes in the process can easily lead to data and location leaks, defeating the purpose of using a VPN. You also need to think about additional challenges, such as hosting and maintenance.   NordVPN  already offers the best VPN infrastructure on the market, with  5582  ultra-fast servers in  60  countries. We also operate under a strict no-logs policy, which was audited and approved twice by trusted experts for our customers’ peace of mind.            What are the best countries to connect to using a VPN?          The best VPN server at any given moment depends on your needs — for example, if you want to share files,  NordVPN  offers servers optimized for P2P traffic. In general, we advise you to choose countries that are close to your actual location, as your  VPN connection  speed depends on your distance to our server.           How do I find my VPN server address?          Simply connect to your chosen VPN server and visit our  What is my IP address  page. It will show you the server’s IP address and location. You can also find your IP address on the NordVPN app by clicking the server you’re connected to at the top of the NordVPN app screen or by clicking “Settings” and then “Statistics.”           What should I do when I can’t connect to a VPN server?          Check your internet connection – then try a different server. If the issue persists, log out and log back in or restart your NordVPN app. If you’re using antivirus software, disable it and try again.
